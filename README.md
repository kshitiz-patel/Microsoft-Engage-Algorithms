## NMovies: A Content-Based Movie Recommender System using Cosine Similarity
### Overview:
**NMovies:** An online movie recommender app based on the concept of **Cosine Similarity**. It basically generates similarity scores based upon those scores movies are suggested to the user. 
Where similarity score is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are like each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained by measuring the similarity between the text details of both items. So, the similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
All the details of the movies (title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB.
